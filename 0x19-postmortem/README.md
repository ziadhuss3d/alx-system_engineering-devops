### Issue Summary
**Duration:** 2 hours (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM GMT)  
**Impact:** 100% service outage for the e-commerce platform. Estimated $50,000 in lost sales.  
**Root Cause:** Database connection misconfiguration leading to server crash.

### Timeline
- **10:00 AM:** Monitoring alert triggered due to high error rates.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineering team notified.
- **10:10 AM:** Initial assumption of DDoS attack; traffic analysis begins.
- **10:30 AM:** Network investigation finds no issues.
- **10:45 AM:** Database team contacted, investigation shifts focus.
- **11:00 AM:** High number of open connections found in database logs.
- **11:15 AM:** Root cause identified as misconfiguration in connection pooling.
- **11:30 AM:** Configuration updated, server restarted.
- **12:00 PM:** Service restored.

### Root Cause and Resolution
The outage was caused by a misconfigured database connection pool, which led to an overload of connections, crashing the server. The issue was resolved by adjusting the connection pool size and restarting the server.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
